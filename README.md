# k_way_merge_sort
algoritm to sort an array by recursively split it to k sub-arrays, and rebuild it using a Min Heap

The main peogram dubbed as "project 2" (excuse my lazyness...) was given as an assignment from the "Data Stuctures" course i took on my second year of CS degree.
As it implies, its a program that recives an array and a constant k to split the array into k "pieces" and recursively sort it.
Inside the "project 2" directory you can find some test files (correct and wrong ones), as well as expected output files.

for Large inputs, I wrote the test program in c++ as well, which accepts 2 full paths, one to the expected output file, and one to the output file generated from the main program.
This tester program can be found on the "proj2_tstFileCopmarator" (Again, sorry for my lazyness...) with a more detailed readme file on it.
